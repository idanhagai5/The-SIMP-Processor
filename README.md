# The SIMP Processor
In this project, I developed both an assembler and a simulator as separate programs for a RISC processor known as SIMP.
Additionally, I authored assembly language programs tailored for the SIMP architecture. The simulator executes each insrtuction within a single clock cycle. 

## registers 
The SIMP processor comprises 16 registers, each 32 bits wide. The following table provides the names, corresponding numbers, and roles of each register:
